# Epic Games Store Weekly Free Games

Automatically login and redeem promotional free games from the Epic Games Store.
Handles multiple accounts, 2FA, captcha bypass, captcha notifications, and scheduled runs.

## Setup

### JSON Configuration

The tool can be configured with a combination of JSON and environment variables. The config file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax (comments, trailing commas, etc). For each property, the JSON config value takes priority over the respective environment variable value.

For details on each option, its defaults, and environment variable key, see the [config documentation site](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html).

The config file is stored in the mounted `/usr/app/config` volume and can be named `config.json` or `config.json5`.

#### `config.json` or `config.json5`

### Captchas

Epic Games currently serves captchas and bot detection to its login and checkout pages. This project works around the issue in two ways:

1. hCaptcha accessibility cookies
1. Sending you captchas

#### hCaptcha accessibility cookies

**This is currently unavailable. See [#178](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/issues/178) for details.**

hCaptcha offers an accessibility tool for vision impaired users that can be used to bypass captchas served by Epic Games. It's very simple to set up:

1. Go [here](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/signup?type=accessibility) and enter an email you have access to
1. In your email inbox find an email titled "Instructions for using hCaptcha Accessibility"
1. Right-click the "Get Accessibility Cookie" button and copy its link address
1. Add the link to your config as the `hcaptchaAccessibilityUrl` option

#### Sending you captchas

For whatever reason, if your IP/account loses trust with hCaptcha, this project can notify and have you manually solve a captcha. To use this requires:

* Access to one of the [notification methods](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#notifiers) (Discord, Telegram, email, Apprise, Pushover, etc.)
* Configuring the captcha solving page webserver
  * Either via local IP or reverse proxy/port forwarding (if you don't know what this means, use the next option)
  * Or by using [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) to very easily remotely tunnel the webserver

See below for detailed instructions on each requirement.

##### Webserver setup

1. Expose port 3000 in your Docker run config (e.g. `-p 81:3000` maps the host machine's port 81 to the container's port 3000)
1. If you want to access the Captcha solving page from outside your network, setup any port forwarding/reverse proxy/DNS
1. Set the `webPortalConfig.baseUrl` in the config
1. The web portal uses WebSocket to communicate. If you're using a reverse proxy, you may need additional configuration to enable WebSocket. [This guide from Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/wiki/Reverse-Proxy) covers most scenarios.

##### Localtunnel setup

If you don't have the ability to port forward/reverse proxy on your network, you can still access captcha remotely by setting:

```jsonc
{
  "webPortalConfig": {
    "localtunnel": true,
  },
}
```

in your `config.json`.

##### Notification setup

Each notification method has unique setup instructions. Read [its documentation]([notification methods](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#notifiers)) on the config site for exact details and instructions. The [example config](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html) may also help as an example.

##### Testing notification and webserver

Since captcas may not always appear, the notification methods and webserver can be manually tested. Essentially, you just need to add:

```jsonc
  "testNotifiers": true,
```

to the root of your `config.json`. For more details check out the [config docs](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html#testNotifiers).

#### Two-factor login

Epic has begun [enforcing two-factor](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/two-factor-authentication-required-when-claiming-free-games) when claiming some free games. It rarely may be necessary for some free games when using this tool.

If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled on your account, you need to add your TOTP secret as an environment variable. To get your TOTP secret, you may need to redo your 2FA setup:

1. Go [here](https://www.epicgames.com/account/password) to enable 2FA.
1. Click "enable authenticator app."
1. In the section labeled "manual entry key," copy the key.
1. Use your authenticator app to add scan the QR code.
1. Activate 2FA by completing the form and clicking activate.
1. Once 2FA is enabled, use the key you copied as the value for the TOTP parameter.

If you can't get 2FA working with this tool, try enabling `MAKE PRIMARY` for "Authenticator App" in your Epic account settings.

### Docker Configuration

This image is available from both [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/pkgs/container/epicgames-freegames-node) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames):

* `ghcr.io/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node:latest`
* `charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`

If you're [experiencing issues with Chromium starting](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/issues/164) (hangs on login/notification), you can try the Debian image:

* `ghcr.io/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node:bullseye-slim`
* `charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:bullseye-slim`

If you are using full JSON configuration, the only remaining Docker configurables are the [port](#ports) and [volume](#volumes).

#### Environment Variables

Most configuration options can be set via environment variable. Look for the `env` tag in the [config docs](https://claabs.github.io/epicgames-freegames-node/classes/AppConfig.html) for each option's key.

If for whatever reason you want to change the default config directory or config file name, `CONFIG_DIR` and `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` are available as environment variables.

#### Ports

| Host port | Container port | Description                                                                   |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `3000`    | `3000`         | Port mapping on which the web server hosting the captcha solving page resides |

#### Volumes

| Host location   | Container location | Mode | Description                               |
|-----------------|--------------------|------|-------------------------------------------|
| `/my/host/dir/` | `/usr/app/config`  | `rw` | Location of the config and cookie file(s) |

#### Memory Limit

It's recommended to add `-m 2g` as a `docker run` parameter to set a max memory usage of 2GB. The Chromium processes can sometimes run away, and without a limit your system will eventually lock up.

### Docker Run

#### With JSON Config

`$ docker run -d -v /my/host/dir/:/usr/app/config:rw -p 3000:3000 -m 2g charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`

#### Without JSON Config

Without JSON config, you can only configure one account.

`$ docker run -d -e TZ=America/Chicago -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e PASSWORD=abc123 -e TOTP=ABC123 -e RUN_ON_STARTUP=true -e BASE_URL=https://example.com -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e SMTP_PORT=587 -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com -e EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS=hello@gmail.com -e EMAIL_SENDER_NAME="Epic Games Captchas" -e EMAIL_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=hello@gmail.com -e SMTP_SECURE=true -e SMTP_USERNAME=hello@gmail.com -e SMTP_PASSWORD=abc123 -v /my/host/dir/:/usr/app/config:rw -p 3000:3000 -m 2g charlocharlie/epicgames-freegames:latest`

### Cookie Import

If you're experiencing issues logging in with username and password, you can import cookies for a temporary session.

1. Setup the container per the below instructions
1. In your web browser, log in to the Epic Games Store with "Remember me" checked.
1. Install the [EditThisCookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com/) browser extension.
1. While viewing the Epic Games Store page, open the EditThisCookie extension window, change the URL to `https://www.epicgames.com/id`, and click the export button:
![EditThisCookie export button](https://github.com/claabs/epicgames-freegames-node/blob/master/img/edit-this-cookie.png?raw=true)
1. In your mounted `./config` folder, create `<email_address>-cookies.json` (e.g. `me@example.com-cookies.json`), and paste in your cookies.
1. Start the container and the cookies will automatically be converted to a new format.

#### Cookie Import Notes

* If you click "Log Out" on the browser session you copied the cookies from, the container may break.
* If you have the container scheduled regularly, it should automatically refresh the cookies and keep you logged in for some time.

## Development

### Recommended Dev Environment Variables

Place these variables in a `.env` file in the project root. These variables support automatic account creation for rapid testing.

| Variable            | Example                     | Description                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SMTP4DEV_URL        | `http://192.168.1.100:5000` | Web UI address for [smtp4dev](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev) instance for automatic account creation |
| SMTP4DEV_USER       | `user`                      | A basic auth username for `smtp4dev` if applicable                                                        |
| SMTP4DEV_PASSWORD   | `abc123`                    | A basic auth password for `smtp4dev` if applicable                                                        |
| CREATION_EMAIL_HOST | `test.example.com`          | The email suffix for newly created accounts                                                               |

## Miscellaneous

### v3 to v4 Migration

In v4, three config options have been deprecated and moved: `email`, `baseUrl`, and `onlyWeekly`. The deprecated options will be automatically converted to the new options at runtime, but you will need to change your `config.json` for a stable solution.

#### `email`

Copy the `email` block into the `notifiers` array and add `"type": "email"` to the email config object.

```jsonc
{
  "email": {
    "smtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "smtpPort": 587,
    "emailSenderAddress": "hello@gmail.com",
    "emailSenderName": "Epic Games Captchas",
    "emailRecipientAddress": "hello@gmail.com",
    "secure": false,
    "auth": {
        "user": "hello@gmail.com",
        "pass": "abc123",
    },
  },

  // ⬇ changes to ⬇

  "notifiers": [
    {
      "type": "email", // This indicates the notifier type
      "smtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
      "smtpPort": 587,
      "emailSenderAddress": "hello@gmail.com",
      "emailSenderName": "Epic Games Captchas",
      "emailRecipientAddress": "hello@gmail.com",
      "secure": false,
      "auth": {
          "user": "hello@gmail.com",
          "pass": "abc123",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

#### `baseUrl`

Move the `baseUrl` block into the `webPortalConfig` config object.

```jsonc
{
  "baseUrl": "https://epic.example.com",

  // ⬇ changes to ⬇
  
  "webPortalConfig": {
    "baseUrl": "https://epic.example.com",
  },
}
```

#### `onlyWeekly`

The `onlyWeekly` boolean has been changed to the `searchStrategy` string.

```jsonc
{
  "onlyWeekly": true,

  // ⬇ changes to ⬇
  
  "searchStrategy": "weekly"
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "onlyWeekly": false,

  // ⬇ changes to ⬇
  
  "searchStrategy": "promotion"
}
```
